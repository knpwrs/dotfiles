/**
 * Apply a voiceover carve to a composition, from the command line.
 *
 * The carve is an analysis: it listens to a voice track, finds the bands it
 * occupies, and writes a chain of dips into the music bed plus a level match. In
 * Studio a panel runs it. This is the same analysis for an agent that has no
 * panel to click — identical functions from `@hyperframes/core`, identical
 * output, so a composition carved here and one carved in Studio are the same
 * three attributes.
 *
 *   node carve.mjs --comp index.html
 *   node carve.mjs --comp index.html --bed music-bed --voice narration \
 *        --voice interview-guest --strength 0.45
 *
 * With no --bed/--voice it works out the tracks itself: the bed, and every voice
 * playing over it. `--voice` may be repeated to name them instead. Every named
 * voice is analysed together, so a bed running under a narrator and an answer makes
 * room for both.
 *
 * Needs `ffmpeg` on PATH (to decode the audio) and `@hyperframes/core` resolvable
 * from the composition's project (`npm i -D @hyperframes/core`) — the CLI bundles
 * core inline rather than shipping it as a package, so it cannot be borrowed from
 * there.

/**
 * The `sources` a carve should record for these voices, on this bed.
 *
 * SKILL.md states the invariant: "A carve against more than one clip id is
 * wrong. Group the clips and carve against the group." Naming the group lets
 * `resolveCarveSourceIds` resolve membership at analysis time, so a voice added
 * later is covered without editing `sources` — whereas a list of clip ids rots
 * silently the moment a fourth narration clip appears. The lint rule
 * `audio_carve_ungrouped_sources` enforces exactly this.
 *
 * This script was writing clip ids unconditionally, so it violated its own
 * skill's invariant and tripped its own lint rule on every run. When every
 * voice shares one group, record the group. Mixed or ungrouped voices keep
 * their ids, and the lint rule then correctly tells the author to group them.
 *
 * The bed has to be part of the decision, because the group form resolves
 * LATER and wider than it looks. If the bed is itself a member of the voices'
 * group, `resolveCarveSourceIds` expands that id to every current member on the
 * next analysis — including the bed — and the bed ends up carved against
 * itself, which SKILL.md calls a bug rather than a mix choice. This run cannot
 * see it: `main()` sums the voice list it detected and never round-trips
 * through group resolution, so the first pass is correct and only the next
 * re-analysis in Studio is wrong. So decline the group form there and fall back
 * to clip ids, which is exactly the case `audio_carve_ungrouped_sources` exists
 * to put in front of the author.
 *
 * Only an `<audio>` bed can trip it: group membership is audio-only
 * (`audioGroupOf`), so `data-audio-group` on a `<video>` bed is ignored by core
 * and expanding a group can never pull it in.

 * `members` is every `<audio>` in the composition as `{id, group, nameKind}`,

 * classify the same way.
 *
 * Required, deliberately not defaulting to `[]`. With an empty list the `mixed`
 * refusal below cannot fire, so a call that forgot the argument would return the
 * group form and restore the exact behaviour this function exists to prevent —
 * silently, because the first CLI pass is correct either way and only a later
 * Studio re-analysis is wrong. A missing argument throws on `members.filter`
 * instead.
 *
 * Two refusals, and both exist because the group form resolves LATER and WIDER
 * than the analysis: `resolveCarveSourceIds` expands a group id to every current
 * member on every analysis, and `resolveCarveVoices` keeps any audio member with
 * a src. `main()` meanwhile sums the voice list `detectTracks` returned, so the
 * first pass looks correct however wrong the persisted attribute is.
 *
 *   `bed`   — the bed is a member, so it would be handed to itself as a voice
 *             and carved against its own content.
 *   `mixed` — a member classified music or sfx is not a voice this run measured,
 *             so it would enter the sidechain on the next analysis and duck the
 *             bed under a whoosh.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a refusal: a member classified `voice` or `unknown` that this
 * run left out. That is the group form working as designed — `detectTracks` only
 * takes voices that overlap the bed, and picking up a clip that starts playing
 * later without an edit to `sources` is the whole reason SKILL.md says to name
 * the group. Refusing there would collapse the group form into clip ids for
 * every ordinary narration sequence.
