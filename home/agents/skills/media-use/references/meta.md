# Ownership matrix, usage stats, telemetry, privacy

Maintainer-facing reference. Nothing here changes how you resolve or operate on media.

## What it owns (the gaps HyperFrames leaves)

HyperFrames owns media _playback_; media-use owns everything else. Each row is enforced by `scripts/lib/coverage.test.mjs` so the claim can't rot.

## Usage stats

Use `resolve --stats` for a local, shareable report over the current project's `.media/` manifest, the global `~/.media/` cache, and local resolve misses. Human output is compact; add `--json` for a single machine-readable object, and `--days N` to window timestamped records.

```bash
npx hyperframes media-use resolve --stats --project . --days 7
# media-use stats
# total resolves: 12
# misses: 2
# hit rate: 86%
```

## Telemetry

`resolve` and the edit tools (transcribe / transcript-cut / audio-duck) send an
anonymous usage event to PostHog (`scripts/lib/telemetry.mjs`), so we can see
which capabilities are actually used. It records only the media TYPE, the
resolution SOURCE, and the winning PROVIDER: never the intent text, file names,
or paths, and `$ip:null` so no IP is stored. Best-effort and non-blocking (a
resolve never waits on or fails from telemetry).

Opt out with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (also off in CI and
dev). Same public PostHog project key and opt-outs as the `hyperframes` CLI.

HeyGen request tagging: every generating `heygen` call (TTS, avatar video, catalog
search) carries the allowlisted `X-HeyGen-Client-Source: media-use` header, sourced
from one shared constant (`HEYGEN_CLIENT_SOURCE_ARGV` in `scripts/lib/heygen-cli.mjs`)
so a future call site can't silently ship untagged. Read-only discovery calls
(`voice list`, `avatar list`) are intentionally left untagged.

## Privacy

media-use uses the same shared install id as the `hyperframes` CLI/studio
(`~/.hyperframes/config.json`). When you are signed in to HeyGen, usage is
linked to your account email, or username when email is unavailable, matching
the CLI behavior. The events stay coarse: media type, source, provider, and
small counts only; intent text and paths stay local. Disable telemetry with
`HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.
