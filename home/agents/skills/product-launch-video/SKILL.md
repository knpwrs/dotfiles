> **media-use**: Before sourcing audio/images/logos, call `/media-use` to resolve BGM/SFX/images from the HeyGen catalog and brand logos from their official sources. Run `--adopt` first to register existing assets. See `/media-use` skill.

> **figma source**: If the source is a figma.com URL, run `/figma` first — asset export, brand tokens, and components/storyboard reconstruction if needed — then build this workflow from its output. Don't drive Figma via raw MCP tools directly: that skips SVG sanitization, `.media/manifest.jsonl` provenance, and brand-token `var()` binding, so a later brand change can't propagate without a full re-import.

# Product Launch to HyperFrames

Use this skill to capture a product, understand its brand, plan a launch video, and build it frame by frame in HyperFrames.

> **The front door is `/hyperframes`.** You are the orchestrator. Run each step, verify its gate, and only then continue to the next step. This skill is for a **product being marketed, launched, promoted, or revealed**, including requests such as "promo for our site" when the purpose is promotional. A site tour / showcase ask stays here too: `BRIEF.md` carries the show-it-as-is intent, and the captured screens become the assets the video features. Any other intent, a bare "make a video", or any uncertainty → read `/hyperframes` first — the intent layer owns every route decision, and a fresh creation arriving here without `BRIEF.md` goes through it anyway (Setup's opening rule).

You are the orchestrator. Work in `videos/<project>/`. Run steps in order and pass each gate before continuing. User-gated steps are Step 0, Step 3, and Step 6. Read `../hyperframes/references/brief-contract.md` before Step 0 — it defines the gate types and how `BRIEF.md`'s `flow`/`storyboard` derive the mode that governs the Step 3/4/6 gates. Do every step yourself except Step 5, where you dispatch one sub-agent per frame. Do not put design or motion rules here; those live in the frame-worker sub-agent, this skill's local `../hyperframes-animation/rules/` + `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints/`, and `hyperframes-creative`.

Workflow: Step 0 setup -> `hyperframes.json`; Step 1 capture -> `capture/`; Step 2 design system -> `frame.md`; Step 3 storyboard/script -> `STORYBOARD.md` and `SCRIPT.md`; Step 3.1 audio -> `audio_meta.json`; Step 4 visual design -> enriched `STORYBOARD.md`; Step 5 frames -> `compositions/frames/NN-*.html` and `index.html`; Step 6 final render -> `renders/video.mp4`.

---

## Step 0: Setup

Goal: Enter with a confirmed brief, create the HyperFrames project, and make the brief durable.

**The brief is confirmed by the intent layer, not by questions asked here.** Opening rule, in order: **(1)** `BRIEF.md` exists → read it and ask nothing — the brief is settled, and its `flow`/`storyboard` derive the mode (brief contract § 1). **(2)** No `BRIEF.md` but the project exists (`hyperframes.json` / `STORYBOARD.md` on disk) → resume from the storyboard's frontmatter and the recorded preferences; never re-interrogate a half-built project. **(3)** Neither — a fresh creation request that arrived here directly → read `/hyperframes` and run its intent layer (`references/intent-interview.md`): it checks recipes and remembered defaults, conducts this route's questions (`../hyperframes/references/routes/product-launch-video.md`), and hands back the locked brief. Edit requests skip all of this — go do the edit.

Initialize only if `hyperframes.json` is missing. Name `<project>` from the brand or domain in kebab-case, such as `acme-promo`; never use workspace name or timestamp.

`npx hyperframes init "videos/<project>" --non-interactive --example=blank --skill=product-launch-video` — `init` checks the installed skills against the latest on GitHub and updates the global set if any are out of date.

After init, let `<PROJECT_ROOT>` be `videos/<project>` and run every subsequent relative-path command with that directory as its working directory. In the commands below, `.` means `<PROJECT_ROOT>`; never write `.media`, `capture`, or output files in the caller directory.

**Write `BRIEF.md` immediately after init** (never before — `init` refuses a non-empty directory): the intent layer's locked brief, shape per `../hyperframes/references/brief-format.md`. Resolve `<MEDIA_DIR>` as the installed `/media-use` skill directory. Then record each preference-backed answer with `node <MEDIA_DIR>/scripts/prefs.mjs record --hyperframes .` (`brief-format.md` names the subset). If the intent layer adopted a recipe, run `node <MEDIA_DIR>/scripts/recipe.mjs use --hyperframes . --name <name>`; it copies its `frame.md` into the project (Step 2 is then skipped) and returns the skeletons Step 3 drafts from. A recipe fills answers, not approvals; the review gates still run.

**Show sign-in status before proceeding past Setup** — run `npx hyperframes auth status` and relay its output verbatim. It reports whether voice/BGM will use HeyGen or local engines and, when signed out, how to sign in. Note the exit code contract: `auth status` **exits 1 when not signed in** (and when the stored credential is rejected) — that non-zero exit is the normal signed-out state, not a command failure, so don't treat it as an error, don't retry it, and don't chain it with `&&`/`set -e` in a way that would abort the workflow. Apply one branch:

- **Collaborative:** wait for the user to sign in or explicitly choose `offline` / `go`.
- **Autonomous:** state the status and continue through the available local engines.

Do not silently omit a required capability when no offline provider exists; surface the blocker. Do not fold this decision into another question or write keys into a per-repo `.env`. Auth ownership and offline fallbacks: `/media-use` `references/setup-providers.md` § Providers.

**Gate:** `hyperframes.json` and `BRIEF.md` exist; the preference-backed answers were recorded (brief contract § 2); sign-in status was shown (signed in, or continuing offline).

---

## Step 1: Capture assets

Goal: Collect the source material, brand signals, and usable assets for the video.

Classify the input and choose the path. Explicit URL -> capture it and use the site for narration and assets. Pasted script/brief -> save verbatim as `user_script.txt`; `VO_MODE` (verbatim or restructured) comes from `BRIEF.md` — the intent layer asks it when a script arrives (ask once here only if the brief somehow lacks it). Then resolve capture target: URL in text -> use it; brand name only -> `WebSearch`, confirm URL in one line, then crawl; no URL/site (or the brief says don't scrape) -> no-capture path.

Run capture with: `npx hyperframes capture "<URL>" -o ./capture --json`. Keep the default
post-navigation budget unless the caller owns a smaller deadline; then pass a positive
`--capture-budget <milliseconds>` that leaves time for downstream work. `--timeout` controls page
navigation only. Use `--skip-vision` only when optional image captioning is intentionally disabled.

Inspect the command result and output directory immediately. A non-zero exit, JSON `ok: false`, or
`capture/BLOCKED.md` is a **hard stop** for the capture path: report the recorded reason and do not
consume partial screenshots, DOM, tokens, or assets. Do not manufacture a synthetic no-capture
fallback after a failed URL capture. Continue through the no-capture path only when the original
brief supplied the source material, or when the user explicitly switches to a provided screenshot
or brief after the failure.

Warnings such as `very little text content` together with an empty asset catalog are not proof of a
usable page. For a site tour or show-it-as-is brief, require trustworthy captured structure or a
provided screenshot; if neither exists, stop. Do not invent or rebuild the page merely because the
capture is unusable.

For a site tour or show-it-as-is brief, the captured page is the visual source of truth. Use the real screenshot instead of rebuilding the full website in HTML. If the shot needs internal movement, keep the screenshot as the base and overlay real captured assets at measured positions, or rebuild only the one component that moves. For a scroll shot, animate the viewport over `capture/screenshots/full-page.png` — the 1x plate of the whole document, pixel-exact for a 1920-wide viewport travelling down it. It is absent when the page was too tall to capture in one piece; fall back to the overlapping scroll-position shots in the same directory. Pushing in past 1:1 wants its own 2x capture of that region instead, since the plate has no headroom above 1x. Recreate the whole page only when the user explicitly asks for a stylized interpretation; an unusable capture alone is not authorization.

If `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or an OpenRouter key exists, capture auto-captions assets into `capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md`. This is not a review gate. Without a vision key, use DOM context and continue.

No-capture path: create `capture/extracted/tokens.json`, `capture/extracted/visible-text.txt`, `capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md`, and `capture/assets/` by hand. `tokens.json` should be `{ "title": "", "description": "", "colors": [], "fonts": [] }`; fill title/description from the brief when possible. `visible-text.txt` contains the full brief or script. `asset-descriptions.md` should say no assets were captured unless the user gave asset notes.

**Gate:** capture JSON reported `ok: true`; `capture/BLOCKED.md` does not exist;
`capture/extracted/tokens.json`, `capture/extracted/visible-text.txt`,
`capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md`, and `capture/assets/` exist; and you can state the brand in
one clear sentence. Treat `asset-descriptions.md` as the main asset inventory. If it is missing after
real capture, stop and report capture incomplete. Warnings about a degraded optional phase are
acceptable only when this structural gate still passes.

---

## Step 2: Design System

Goal: Choose one shipped frame preset; a script turns it into this video's `frame.md` + caption skin.

When `BRIEF.md` names a `style_preset` — the user picked it by eye from the showcases at the intent layer — use it; the judgment call is yours only when the brief is silent. Then you make the one call — **which preset**: read `../hyperframes-creative/references/design-spec.md` and pick the preset whose look best fits the brand and brief. Then run:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/build-frame.mjs --preset <name> --hyperframes .
```

The script does the rest deterministically: copies the preset's `FRAME.md` → `frame.md` and **remixes** it onto the brand tokens in `capture/extracted/tokens.json` (brand colors mapped onto the preset's color keys by role — ink, canvas, accents — keeping keys/structure/components; the preset's display + body fonts swapped for the brand's), copies the preset's caption skin to `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html`, and self-validates (exits 1 on a broken mapping). Proceed to the next step as soon as it exits 0 — no hand-editing of the spec.

`tokens.json` with no brand colors/fonts (e.g. no capture) → the script keeps the preset's own palette, a complete shippable design. If the brief names brand colors/fonts the capture missed, add them to `capture/extracted/tokens.json` before running (or use the user's `design.md` to populate it); only adjust `frame.md` by hand afterward if a mapping truly needs it.

**Gate:** `build-frame.mjs` exited 0 — `frame.md` exists from a named preset, and (when the preset ships one) `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html` exists as the caption skin source; the chosen preset was recorded as a preference (`--key style_preset --workflow <this workflow>`, brief contract § 2).

---

## Step 3: Storyboard and Script

Goal: Turn the brief and captured material into an approved frame-by-frame story plan.

Read `../hyperframes-creative/references/story-spine.md` (hook language, value-before-evidence, storyboard-as-proposal, source-traceable visuals), `references/story-design.md`, `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`, `../hyperframes/references/storyboard-format.md`, and `../hyperframes/references/script-format.md`. Use them to write `STORYBOARD.md` and, when narration is needed, `SCRIPT.md`. Set the frontmatter `duration:` from the brief's `length` — a rough expectation; assembly reports where the cut lands against it.

Use `story-design.md` for story blueprint, hook, persuasion logic, beats, `VO_MODE`, and asset choices. As a **soft guide**, consult the role→blueprint menu in `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`: for each beat, note a candidate blueprint id when one fits. Story truth still decides which beats exist — never force a beat to fit a blueprint, and never invent a beat just because a proven shape is available. Choose each visual frame's `asset_candidates` from `capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md` (the canonical inventory) — don't browse raw `capture/assets/`. Do not ask the user to pick assets unless that inventory is missing or unusable. Use the exact required fields from the storyboard and script references.

After drafting, run the review loop's plan pass — `../hyperframes/references/review-loop.md` § 1: present the plan as a proposal, and ask the two questions — approve or change, and **sketches first** (recommended) or skip. Feedback arrives as a chat reply; loop until approved. This is a **checkpoint gate** (brief contract § 1): in autonomous mode there is nothing to ask — post the same summary as a heads-up and proceed; sketches collapse into the build, and the one preview question comes at Step 6.

**Gate:** `STORYBOARD.md` exists, every visual frame has `asset_candidates`, `SCRIPT.md` exists when narration is needed, and the user approved the frame-by-frame plan (autonomous: the summary was posted as a heads-up).

---

## Step 3.1: Audio

Goal: Generate narration, word timings, music, and audio metadata from the approved script.

Start audio after Step 3 approval. Run it in the background, then continue to Step 4.

**Choose the narration provider and voice from the user's ask before invoking.** Pass the provider selected in Step 0 with `--provider <provider>` (or set `HF_TTS_PROVIDER`). If the request named a voice, gender, or tone, pick a matching voice id and pass it with `--voice <id>`. The pipeline default is otherwise **Marcia (female)** on HeyGen / `am_michael` on Kokoro — so a request like "a male voice" is silently ignored unless you pass the flag. Voice ids are provider-specific; resolve against whichever provider Step 0's sign-in status selected: **HeyGen** (signed in) via `node <MEDIA_DIR>/audio/scripts/heygen-tts.mjs --list` (or `GET /v3/voices?engine=starfish`); **Kokoro** (offline) via the voice table in `<MEDIA_DIR>/audio/references/tts.md` (prefixes `am_`/`bm_` male, `af_`/`bf_` female). When the user expressed no preference, fall back to the remembered voice (brief contract § 2) before the pipeline default, and say which one you used; omit `--voice` only when neither names one. When the user explicitly picked a voice this run, record it (`prefs.mjs record --key voice`).

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs --script ./SCRIPT.md --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes . --out ./audio_meta.json --provider <provider> --voice <voice-id> &`

The audio script handles narration, word timings, BGM lookup from HeyGen's music library, and timing metadata. BGM mood comes from the storyboard's `music:` field; **`music: none` turns BGM off**. This uses the HeyGen Audio API for retrieval, not generation, and uses the same `~/.heygen` credential as TTS. For provider details, read `../media-use/audio/references/tts.md`.

If there is no narration and no `SCRIPT.md`, skip voice generation. BGM may still run if the storyboard has a music mood.

**The canonical fully-silent marker:** `music: none` in the STORYBOARD.md top YAML block **and** no `SCRIPT.md`. That combination marks the project silent — no narration, no BGM, no SFX. `audio.mjs` recognizes it and generates nothing (it removes any stale `audio_meta.json`; an absent `audio_meta.json` is what assemble treats as silent), so Step 3.1 is a clean skip. Use it when the user asks for a silent / music-free video — don't improvise other spellings.

**Gate:** audio job has started, or the project is marked silent (`music: none` + no `SCRIPT.md`).

---

## Step 4: Frame Visual Design

Goal: Add the visual direction, layout intent, and motion choices to each storyboard frame.

**Sketch the storyboard sheet first (collaborative only).** The moment the plan is approved, run the sketch pass — `../hyperframes/references/review-loop.md` § 2 (don't wait on Step 3.1; sketches don't use timings): wireframe every frame yourself as a cell of `storyboard.html` (`../hyperframes-creative/references/storyboard-recipe.md` § 3), mark each `built`, pause for the one layout question when every frame is `built`, and revise only the sketches named until the sheet is confirmed. Stand-ins: plain labeled blocks for the captured assets — the real files arrive with Step 5's workers. Only then write the visual design below onto the confirmed layouts. In autonomous mode, or when the user chose to skip sketches at Step 3, skip this pass — frames go straight from `outline` to `animated` at Step 5.

Edit `STORYBOARD.md` in place. Do not create another storyboard. Use `frame.md` as source of truth for color, type, layout feel, and style.

Read `references/visual-design.md`, `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`, `references/motion-language.md`, and `../hyperframes-animation/rules-index.md`. Use `visual-design.md` for the method (the time-coded shot sequence, the inline Layout vocabulary, and the required `## Video direction` block). Use `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md` to pick each frame's shot shape. Use `motion-language.md` (the motion vocabulary + the motion doctrine) and `../hyperframes-animation/rules-index.md` (valid rule names) for motion — do not invent motion names.

**Search the live catalog before you design any named look.** For every look, effect, treatment or transition the brief names — "CRT scanlines", "glitch", "film grain", "shimmer sweep", "confetti burst" — run `npx hyperframes catalog --query "<the look, in plain English>" --json` and read the top results BEFORE you write that look into `STORYBOARD.md`. The search needs **nothing installed**: no project, no prior `add`, no account. It ranks the whole hosted registry (~400 blocks and components) from any directory. A block that already does the job becomes the frame's `focal` — name it here, so Step 5's workers install and customize it instead of rebuilding it. Hand-author a look only after a search for it came back with nothing that fits.

For every visual frame, write a **time-coded shot sequence** into `STORYBOARD.md` per `visual-design.md`'s method: pick the frame's blueprint (or compose), instantiate it with THIS product's content, and pace each Scene's reveal to the voiceover so the frame develops across its full duration instead of front-loading then freezing. State layout and motion **inline** per Scene (vocabularies in `visual-design.md` and `motion-language.md`). Add one video-wide `## Video direction` block.

When an element visibly continues across a frame boundary, give both workers the same numerical handoff in `STORYBOARD.md`: add `handoff_out:` to the outgoing frame and a matching `handoff_in:` to the incoming frame. Name the element and its exact x/y position, scale, opacity, and motion direction/speed at the cut — state every field even when it does not change, because a constant is `opacity: 1`, not an omission. Omit the whole block only for a deliberate clean cut. The goal is simple: parallel workers must not invent two different versions of the same seam.

Do not change story, script, asset choices, `asset_candidates`, `transition_in`, or captured source material. Do not write HTML in this step.

Stage named assets after visual design is locked:

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/stage-assets.mjs --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

**Gate:** every visual frame has a time-coded shot sequence whose reveals are paced to the voiceover (no front-loading); `## Video direction` exists; `assets/` contains the named assets. Collaborative: the sketch sheet was confirmed.

---

## Step 5: Build Frames

Goal: Build every storyboard frame as an HTML composition and assemble the playable video.

Wait for Step 3.1 audio to finish if audio was started. Then sync durations and fetch SFX; skip both if silent.

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs sync-durations --audio-meta ./audio_meta.json --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs fetch-sfx --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

Duration sync is mechanical: real voice duration wins; silent frames keep estimates; never hand-edit synced durations.

Check the music against the final cut before assembly. A library track can match the requested mood but open on a quiet build that drains the first seconds of a short launch video. Compare the opening with later five-second sections; when a later section has a stronger, musically clean start, trim from there and keep a short fade-in plus a longer fade-out. If frame or narration timing changes, redo this check against the new final duration so the music never ends early or leaves silence at the tail.

Before dispatch, read `../hyperframes/references/subagent-dispatch.md`. Build the per-frame packets and the worker role payload:

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/frame-packets.mjs --project "$PROJECT_DIR" --storyboard "$PROJECT_DIR/STORYBOARD.md"`

The builder writes one bounded packet per frame under `.hyperframes/frame-packets/` (the frame's exact storyboard block + the blueprint body + every cited rule recipe, inlined) and `_role.md` (`../hyperframes/references/frame-worker-core.md` + this skill's `sub-agents/frame-worker.md`, concatenated verbatim — the complete worker role). Dispatch one sub-agent per frame, in parallel if possible; otherwise run workers in waves. Each worker gets exactly one frame: its prompt carries `_role.md` and that frame's packet — paste both in full, or hand the two file paths for the worker to read first (equivalent; the worker starts from exactly those two documents either way) — plus a dispatch context with `PROJECT_DIR`, `frame_id`, whether the frame has a **confirmed sketch** on disk (the worker dresses that layout rather than redrawing it — frame-worker core § When a confirmed sketch exists), canvas size, and caption status + keep-out band if captions are enabled.

Workers read only their packet and `frame.md`; they never open `STORYBOARD.md` or the skill documents (the packet inlines what was selected upstream). Each worker writes only `compositions/frames/NN-*.html`. Workers must never edit `STORYBOARD.md`.

**Full-bleed backgrounds ride on a `class="clip"` layer, never the `#root`.** A frame's ground (color field / gradient / grid) is its own full-duration background clip — a `background` set on the `#root` / `data-composition-id` element is clip-gated to the frame's window and is not a dependable ground, so dark content can land on the black host `body` and render invisible. The video's base ground is painted by the assembler from `frame.md`'s `canvas` color onto the index `#root`. (Full rule + self-check: `../hyperframes/references/frame-worker-core.md`.)

As each worker returns, the orchestrator marks that frame as `animated` in `STORYBOARD.md`.

After audio timings exist, build captions in the background and assemble the index:

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/captions.mjs build --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --audio-meta ./audio_meta.json --hyperframes . --out ./caption_groups.json &`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/assemble-index.mjs --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

`captions.mjs` uses the project's `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html` (copied in Step 2) as the caption look, injecting brand tokens from `frame.md`; with no skin present it renders the built-in default pill. `captions: skipped (<reason>)` is valid. Continue without captions when explicitly skipped.

**Gate:** every frame is marked `animated` (collaborative: the sketch sheet was confirmed at Step 4), `index.html` exists, and captions are built or explicitly skipped.

---

## Step 6: Finalize

Goal: Verify the assembled video, get user approval, and render the final MP4.

Inject transitions, run checks, pause for review, then render.

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/transitions.mjs inject --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/transitions.mjs verify --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --index ./index.html`

`npx hyperframes lint`

`npx hyperframes check`

`npx hyperframes snapshot --at <frame-midpoints-and-each-cut-minus-0.1s-and-plus-0.2s>`

`snapshot` stitches the captured frames into one contact sheet (`snapshots/contact-sheet.jpg`). Inspect the midpoint frames for layout failures, then compare the two images around every cut. A continuing element must keep the promised position, scale, opacity, and direction; fix any visible pop before rendering.

If a command fails, surface stderr and stop — don't pile on recovery commands. Fix it yourself: the cheapest safe edit to `compositions/frames/NN-*.html`, then rerun the failed check.

After checks pass, pause for user review — the review loop's final look (`../hyperframes/references/review-loop.md` § 4): one question, on the final Studio preview — render now, or what changes? (Autonomous: the one kept question, preview first or render.) Then deliver the MP4 with the contact sheet and the frame ids so revisions can target a single frame.

Preview: `npx hyperframes preview --background`

Render only after user approval (autonomous mode: after the preview-or-render question):

`npx hyperframes render --skill=product-launch-video --quality high --output renders/video.mp4`

Do not rerun `lint`, `check`, or `snapshot` after rendering unless the user asks.

**Gate:** `lint` and `check` passed and the snapshots were inspected before render; user approved at the review pause (autonomous: checks passed and the delivery includes the contact sheet); `renders/video.mp4` exists. Final reply states MP4 path and final duration.

---

## Quick Reference

**Formats:** landscape `1920x1080`; portrait `1080x1920`; square `1080x1080` — derived from the destination (brief contract § 2). Set the format once in the storyboard frontmatter.

**Background scripts:** the workflow ships only these scripts under `scripts/`: `build-frame` for adopting + brand-remixing a frame preset into `frame.md` (+ caption skin); `audio` for TTS, transcription, BGM, SFX, and duration syncing; `captions`; `transitions` for inject and verify; `stage-assets` for copying frame-named assets into `assets/`; and `assemble-index`. Everything else is handled by the `hyperframes` CLI.

The reusable, product-agnostic shot shapes live in `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints/` (indexed by `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`).
